# British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the work I completed as part of the British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship. The internship involved two main tasks: web scraping and data analysis, and machine learning model development. Below is a detailed description of each task, including the steps taken and the insights gained.

## Task 1: Web Scraping and Data Analysis

### Objective
The goal of this task was to scrape review data from the Skytrax website, clean and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights, and present the findings in a single PowerPoint slide.

### Steps

1. **Scrape Data from the Web:**
    - Utilized Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape review data from the Skytrax website.
    - Focused specifically on reviews about British Airways to gather as much relevant data as possible.
    - Stored the scraped data in a structured format within a CSV file.

2. **Analyze Data:**
    - Cleaned the raw text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
    - Performed various analyses including:
        - **Sentiment Analysis:** Determined the overall sentiment of the reviews (positive, negative, neutral).
        - **Topic Modelling:** Identified common themes and topics discussed in the reviews.
        - **Word Clouds:** Visualized the most frequently mentioned words in the reviews.
    - Used Python libraries such as Pandas, NLTK, and matplotlib for data cleaning and analysis.

3. **Present Insights:**
    - Created visualizations and metrics to summarize the findings.
    - Used the provided PowerPoint template to compile the key points and insights from the analysis.
    - Delivered a concise and informative slide for presentation at the next board meeting.

## Task 2: Machine Learning Model Development

### Objective
The aim of this task was to explore and prepare a dataset for predictive modeling, train a machine learning model to predict customer bookings, and evaluate and present the model's performance.

### Steps

1. **Explore and Prepare the Dataset:**
    - Loaded and explored the dataset using the provided Jupyter Notebook.
    - Conducted basic statistical analysis to understand the different columns and their distributions.
    - Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

2. **Train a Machine Learning Model:**
    - Prepared the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
    - Trained a RandomForest model to predict whether a customer would make a booking.
    - Selected RandomForest due to its ability to provide feature importance and interpretability.

3. **Evaluate Model and Present Findings:**
    - Evaluated the model's performance using cross-validation and appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
    - Created visualizations to interpret how each variable contributed to the model’s predictions.
    - Summarized the model’s performance and key insights in a single PowerPoint slide using the provided template.

## Conclusion

The British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship provided valuable experience in web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning model development. The tasks completed during this internship have enhanced my skills in these areas and provided practical experience with real-world data.
